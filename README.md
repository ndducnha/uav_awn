Road traffic management is an essential aspect of transportation, especially in urban areas, where traffic congestion can lead to significant problems, such as air pollution and delays. Therefore, developing reliable and efficient traffic management systems is crucial. To achieve this, artificial vision algorithms can be trained to recognize different types of vehicles and their movements in the road network, which can aid in developing efficient traffic management systems.
One critical component of training artificial vision algorithms is access to a diverse dataset with annotated images of vehicles. However, creating such a dataset is often time-consuming and requires considerable resources. To address this issue, a dataset of Spanish road traffic images was developed in this article, obtained from unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV).
The dataset comprises 15,070 images and can be used to train artificial vision algorithms, including those based on convolutional neural networks. The creation process involved multiple stages, including the acquisition of data and images, vehicle labeling, anonymization, and data validation using a simple neural network model. The images were captured using drones, which are similar to those that could be obtained by fixed cameras, in the field of intelligent vehicle management. The dataset provides a wide range of images that capture different types of vehicles in various contexts, such as urban and rural areas, highways, and streets. The presented dataset has the potential to enhance the performance of road traffic vision and management systems. It can aid researchers in developing and testing algorithms that recognize different types of vehicles, their speeds, and movements, which can help optimize traffic flow and reduce congestion.

In summary, the dataset presented can be an invaluable resource for researchers and practitioners working in the field of road traffic management. Its availability can lead to the development of more efficient and reliable traffic management systems, which can significantly improve transportation in urban areas.
